ReleaseNote for pilot and pico
------------------------------

Pico and Pilot are based on the University of Washington 'Pine' newsreader.

These ports are not intended for any purpose other than to simplify editing
files in a taskwindow, for example from another process in a taskwindow.
The major example of this kind of use would be that of CVS log editing.

Base source: Pine 4.63

Changes from the official sources :
  * Changes to code to conform better to standard C, and to compile under
    RISC OS Norcroft compiler.
  * Addition of 'ANSI' and 'native' output modes. By default the tools will
    use native mode. The -A switch will enable ANSI mode, allowing pico to be
    used in an environment that expects ANSI (eg under TelnetD).
  * Support for ESC[6~/ESC[5~ style paging (as used by Nettle under ANSI
    taskwindow).
  * Version string declares as Pilot 2.0L and Pico 4.10L.
  * The variable Pilot$Pager will be used in place of PAGER.
  * The variable Pilot$Editor will be used in favour of EDITOR (also
    supported). The use of the alternate editor is limited, but could be
    set to 'ee -t &FFF' to edit in a normal Zap window. Why you would want
    to do this is somewhat beyond me, though.
  * The variable Pico$Lines will be used if present and in a taskwindow.
    If not present, LINES will be used. If neither of these are present,
    the default will be used.
  * Pico$Columns and COLUMNS will be used in the same way.
  * Pico$Spell will be used over SPELL, although spell checking has not been
    tested with a working spell check tool.
  * Mailbox check is disabled.
  * Mouse support is disabled.
